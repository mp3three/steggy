## Docker Containers

### Home Controller: [backend](../apps/home-controller) + [frontend](../apps/home-configure)

The Controller is an application that integrates with Home Assistant, through the websocket api, for the purpose of driving automation logic.
Simple automations can be built up through a builder UI.
More advanced automation logic can be provided via code editors embedded in the application, which provide full typescript language features.
