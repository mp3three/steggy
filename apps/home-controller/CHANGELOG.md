# Changelog

## 0.12.0

- Added Routine Command: Call Service
  - Pulls a list of available domains, and the services they support, and all the available options
  - Will present a form, which will allow for selection of:
    - entity_id
    - service
    - properties to send with request
  - Sends request via socket api

### 0.9.12

Added new section to settings page which shows lists of currently broken routines / groups / rooms. The reason for inclusion in the list is currently only available in the warning logs of the server. Possible reasons include:

- reference to invalid room / room state / room metadata property
- reference to missing entity id
- reference to invalid routine
- reference to invalid group / group save state

Can be used to assist in the restoration of functionality if an a Home Assistant integration resets everything back to default entity ids (ðŸ˜¢)

### 0.9.10

- Added error checks to all lookups by entity id
  - If an entity doesn't exist for the UI, a basic error notification is emitted
  - No updates for controller, it already seems to gracefully handles missing entities
- Added entity id renamer
