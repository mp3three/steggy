# Description

This is a microservice I use to tie into the Home Assistant websocket API and control my house. It acts as a bit of a catch-all repo for random functionality I want running here.

Some of the code will be set up for my particular situation, but I will be trying to make it more generic as time goes on / additional repository tooling becomes available.
